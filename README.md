This is the code for the final project by Niyant Narang and Robert Isaac for ECE C147. The structure, data structures, and environments are all from https://github.com/AI4Finance-LLC/Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-for-Automated-Stock-Trading-Ensemble-Strategy-ICAIF-2020. We are in no way taking authorship of the vast majority of the code. We simply changed the environments to include a set of two weeks of data as the state/observation space to use in an LSTM policy in the Advantage Actor Critic and Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms provided by OpenAI in https://github.com/openai/baselines.
